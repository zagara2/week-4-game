# Sonic's Chaos Emerald Challenge!

## What is it?

Chaos Emerald Challenge is a blackjack-like arithmetic game. The player is given a random number at the start of the game. Each of the 4 emeralds on the screen is given a different hidden numeric value. By clicking an emerald, the player will add a specific amount of points to his/her total score. A win occurs by matching one's total score to the random number displayed. A loss occurs if one's total score goes above the random number. The game restarts automatically upon a win or a loss, after displaying an animation and music. Every time the game starts, the value of the emeralds changes.

The player's total wins and losses are displayed on the left sidebar, and the player's total score for the current round is displayed on the right sidebar.

The site is currently deployed at https://zagara2.github.io/week-4-game/ .

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* JQuery

## Browser and Screen Compatibility

### Browser Tests

The site has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari, and works perfectly in all of them.

### Screen Compatibility Tests

The site is best viewed on a small to moderately large desktop (between 1280x1024 and 1680x1050), but looks good on essentially any modern device's screen resolution. This includes both a 10" and 12" Netbook, a 13" and 15" notebook, 19"-24" desktops, Kindle Fire, Asus Nexus 7, iPad and iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy tab, Microsoft Surface Pro, iPhone 3 and up (including iPhone 6-7 plus), Galaxy S2 and up, LG G 3-5, and 480p, 720p and 1080p televisions. 

When the page is loaded properly, it should look like this:

## Future Plans for Improvement

* Add a footer to the site.

* Find a somewhat shorter sound for the losing animation. 

* Load all images at the start of the game (including the win/loss images), and hide them as needed. This will make it so that there is no loading delay for the win/loss image the first time the player experiences a win/loss.
